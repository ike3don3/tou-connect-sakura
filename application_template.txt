Project Title: TOU Connect - Student Networking Platform for Tokyo Online University

Project Description:
I am developing an educational platform to help students at Tokyo Online University (TOU) connect with each other and build academic communities. As a distance learning institution, TOU students often struggle to form meaningful connections with their peers due to the lack of physical campus interactions.

Specific Use Cases:
1. Profile Analysis: Analyze public Twitter profiles to identify TOU-related accounts and academic interests
2. Interest Extraction: Extract academic interests, study fields, and learning patterns from public tweets
3. Community Building: Help students find study partners with similar academic interests and goals
4. Academic Support: Facilitate collaboration on coursework, projects, and study groups
5. Networking Facilitation: Connect students based on complementary skills and shared academic pursuits

Data Usage and Privacy:
- Only public profile information and tweets will be accessed
- No private messages, DMs, or protected content will be accessed
- Data will be used solely for academic networking and educational purposes
- All data handling will comply with privacy regulations and Twitter's terms of service
- Personal information will be anonymized and aggregated for analysis
- No data will be sold, shared with third parties, or used for commercial purposes

Technical Implementation:
- Using Twitter API v2 Basic tier (respecting 10,000 tweets/month limit)
- Implementing proper rate limiting and caching mechanisms
- Storing only aggregated, anonymized insights for matching purposes
- Using AI analysis (Google Gemini) to extract academic interests and compatibility
- No automated posting or engagement - read-only access only

Educational Impact:
This platform addresses a significant challenge in distance education by helping students overcome isolation and build meaningful academic relationships. The goal is to improve learning outcomes, increase student engagement, and enhance the overall university experience for distance learning students.

The project is purely educational and non-commercial, aimed at supporting the academic success and social well-being of university students in a digital learning environment.
